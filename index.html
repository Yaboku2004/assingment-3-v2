            <h3>+ Nguyen Dung Tri</h3>
            <p>Nguyen Dung Tri is my name, and my student ID number is S3979077. My school's SID is S3979077@rmit.edu.vn, and my contact email is nguyendungtri123321@gmail.com. I was born and raised in District 8 of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I graduated from Saigon High School with a major in IT, and I'm currently enrolled at RMIT. Vietnamese and English are the two languages I can speak. My home has several birds, two cats, five dogs, and five fish. I do participate in sports like tennis and boxing. When I was younger, I enjoyed playing badminton and going swimming. I like IT because I can make websites, games, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy creating things on my own and hope to inspire others. I've gained some knowledge of Python, C++, C#, HTML, and Python. Additionally, I created a little website and a game prototype that I later lost when my PC was reset. I get both incredibly excited and frustrated when I'm coding. And finally, I would like to work as a web and game developer. After working with them, I have significantly changed my thinking and attitude, becoming more positive and fun.</p>
            <h3>+ Bui Quoc Huy</h3>
            <p>My name is Bui Quoc Huy, and I am a student at RMIT University in Ho Chi Minh City. I reside in District 7, and my student ID is S3979446. I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with my friends in my free time, which helps me unwind after studying. Additionally, I am an avid badminton player, as it helps me release any pent-up negative energy and allows me to expand my social circle. As someone who loves playing games, I am interested in learning about the game coding process to understand better how characters move and use their abilities. While I am still a novice in this field, the international environment at RMIT University will provide me with the perfect platform to achieve my future goals.
            </p>
            <h3>+ Vu Nguyen Phuc Lam</h3>
            <p>I'm Vu Nguyen Phuc Lam, a 19-year-old Vietnamese national born on January 1st, 2004, in Thanh Hoa, where I was raised. My student ID is 3976441. I attended math honors class and received my high school degree from Gia Dinh. I speak a bit of English in addition to Vietnamese, though I could do better right now. But I want to get better at English in the future. I am intensely interested in sports because I can play various sports, including badminton, table tennis, swimming, football, basketball, and volleyball. To fulfill a longtime desire to visit the entire planet, I now travel to certain countries close to Vietnam, such as China, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, and Malaysia. I like exploring independently and learning new things, but doing so requires much work, finding the proper career, making a lot of money, and perseverance. To say that ever since studying computer science in secondary school, I have developed a deep enthusiasm for and interest in information technology. I once thought that having a solid foundation in mathematics would help me in the future. Still, I've since realized this talent is essential to my success in information technology. I became interested in IT, especially robotics and AI, during high school when there was a scientific fair featuring a range of intriguing projects and products. I want to pick them all up and hone my skills to find rewarding employment, despite needing more knowledge and ideas in this area. I have changed myself a lot to adapt and fit with this team. I have to work harder and more creatively to help them.
            </p>
            <h3>+ Tran Vu Thinh</h3>
            <p>My full name is Tran Vu Thinh,  my student ID is S3932811, and my personal and professional email addresses are vxthinnn@gmail.com. I was born in Dalat City, one of the most famous places in Vietnam, which is recognized for its many flowers and great environment. I gained a lot of knowledge about becoming more mature and thriving in my future work after graduating from Nguyen Khuyen High School, which helped me on my path to college. However, English and a small amount of Korean are two more languages I have acquired outside of my native Vietnamese, where I was born and raised. My favorite pastimes include playing fighting games, researching social media trends, doing something connected to my course material, particularly IT and computers, and playing basketball. I sometimes get attracted to IT coding. Even though I lack experience in IT, my desire to become proficient in the field has motivated me to study at RMIT and learn how to code. Additionally, the Big Five Personality Test results I took earlier indicated that I am more introverted than extroverted. As a result, I am sensitive to others' feelings and, in some situations, make people happy before managing a situation that can touch others' emotions. Due to my mixed introversion, conversation interaction will remain the same. Since I don't identify as introverted, the conversation won't involve less interaction. I always want to share, but while working on projects or in groups, I want to give them feedback and am open to hearing what others say. This may encourage others in the group to believe in me when we face challenges. Working with Vin quickly is still my ideal job because it directly relates to my topic of study. After completing this bachelor's program, I won't hesitate to apply for this job. Although there are numerous requirements, I will work to create them gradually.

            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h2>+ Topic:</h2>
            <p>Create open-world adventure games with engaging stories, immersive gameplay, and detailed environments with heritage and realistic sightseeing worldwide. Players can explore vast landscapes, interact with NPCs, and discover all the heritage and sightseeing worldwide. It offers exploring options like planes, ships, cars, and motorbikes. It presents challenges requiring strategy, knowledge, and skill. Ultimately it creates a satisfying experience for the player. 
               <p>Our wanted outcomes are to receive investment and popularity from the public and receive their support. The next thing is that when we make video games, we can be exposed to many other fields like graphic design, advanced programming, or collaborating with famous companies such as “Mihoyo” and  “Mojang”. Lastly, we want to create something that can entertain people and partly combine with learning to help improve knowledge or increase creativity and intelligence for young people instead of just studying at school. We also want everyone to know about other countries' history and beautiful sights.                </p>
            </p>
            <h2>+ Motivation:</h2>
            <p>Several reasons motivated me to develop this game. First and foremost, we are huge fans of the open world, exploration, adventure, and history, and combining these genres creates an exciting and unique experience. Next, I would like to examine the concepts of freedom, learning, and hope in the context of video games. These are important and relevant issues today, and video games can be a powerful tool to address them. Thirdly, this game will be a great addition to my portfolio and show potential employers that I can create new and exciting video games. One of the significant trends in IT today is the development of video games, a popular form of entertainment that brings tons of revenue to the entertainment industry. New video game technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality, also bring new possibilities to the industry.
            </p>
            <h2>+ Landscape:</h2>
            <p>There are many similar video games out there today, such as “Genshin Impact”, “Honkai Impact”, and “Minecraft”,... However, I believe my game will be unique as it blends aspects of open-world games. I also think that the story and ideas of my project will be different from other video games on the market. My video game differs from existing video games in several ways. First, it merges exploration, learning, and solving. This provides players with a unique and immersive experience. Second, my games have in-depth stories about the country’s freedom, history, learning, and knowledge. These are essential and timely issues in today's world, and I believe video games can be an effective way to explore them. Third, my game would look great. We intend to build an immersive and realistic world by combining cutting-edge video game technology.

            <h1>Details</h1>
            <h3>Aims</h3>
            <p>
                Firstly, our team had a project to create a game called “Travelling around the World”. This game is all about the way to travel, like an adventure in any way. To make this game an attractive app and entertainment for adults and children, we have already discussed and researched the exact knowledge, history, and culture worldwide. To be honest, our group thinks that researching every detail of each country can be a waste of time, and the duration to finish this app is too long. Still, nowadays, there are too many sources on the internet that can help us more easily to find out what we want. Based on a small part of what we mentioned above, we aim to get people's achievements and experiences through each culture of each country they go through, which they can then bring to this achievement to save to their profile, other players can see it, and maybe they will admire you.
  	Furthermore, not to mention that you have learned a lot of knowledge about the world, but no one is forcing you because you know through your joy or passion based on this game of ours. For example, suppose you are a person that participates in the game and travels to the country that you are willing to travel to in real life. In that case, you will be able to check out the specific things and the behaviors of people of their country, through which you can be more sympathetic and invested in your trip; you may love it.     	
Moving to the unsatisfactory part of the plan, if we have features that are hard to fix, we will try to fix them based on everyone's input and maybe simplify the game for those who need it, and that bug won’t affect multiplayer. Moreover, we aim to make players feel less stressed about work and life activities that cause fatigue. We place more importance on entertainment than exploring every detail, so if we don't have time to work on this plan, the priority for this game is the graphics and the most outstanding features of each country.
  	To sum up, we aim to help the young generation with new fundamental knowledge from reputable sources of knowledge from many references. We already know the vital part you are working towards to make the game more engaging. Moreover, we will rely on previously released games to develop every detail and avoid many risks that might happen in the future.

            </p>
            <h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
            <p>
                As you all know, our project was to make an adventure game, and it took a lot of elements to perfect. To start, we study creating games using Unity, C#, and Python language. By using Unity, we will get a preview of the game's simulation as well as the flawless graphics created by Unity. To move on to Python, our team can code the game's progress, and we can use some of the code to draw some titles, characters, and logo for the game. Most of our progress is unlimited imagination, but we have already tried Unity 3D, and the result makes us feel confident to continue the project.
                Perfecting this game is challenging; it requires a lot of experience and many talented members in graphic design and coding. Therefore, we need to keep learning daily, incorporating more sources of knowledge, and ultimately learning more by experiencing similar game genres. We had a lot of hesitation when working on an open-world game, but the progress of players in this genre is increasing, which motivates us to try harder.
                About our "story", after being given an exercise on the project, we immediately thought about making games. Four people in the group all have a passion for playing games, and some play games. For fun, some people play for achievement, so we decided to combine those two purposes to create a common opinion. We're at the point where we're starting to learn about making an educational game. We've looked through many social media resources, and this could progress in the future. In addition, we were able to apply the lessons we had in college to make the jumps in the project, which is part of the time-saving.
                Imagine that those things can help our team in this project; what is required are the small details and steps taken in the whole process of making the game, as well as the resources that are intended to aid in the programming. And if the project wraps up at the end of the semester with a new team, we'll need the basics of game making, at least a finished 2D game. Moreover, this requires a person with drawing skills and a rich brain to avoid getting bored of having the same idea with previously released games.
                
            </p>
            <h3>Roles</h3>
            <p>
                To begin with, the division of roles within a team can be uncertain in the opening stages. But if precisely each of the arrays is divided equally for each critical skill, our team can position each person to take on each task. Through this, the talented people on the team will be able to take turns helping the rest of the group or can contribute to the hard work. As for not having a specific role in the project, we will sit down and work together on small steps to completion, which can be time-consuming. Still, my team will only make mistakes worth it if there is a period of checking every detail and then the next steps.
            </p>
            <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
            <p>
                In this project, the most challenging thing to do is multiplayer mode. Another limitation is tracing the world in every detail. This section will require much time to develop and fix the error. In the first step, we will launch the game in Single Player Mode, where there is only one user in the world, and they will be surrounded by NPC (Non-playable character). In the game's early access, players can only enjoy a part of the world because the game is still developing. However, the mechanism and systems that have been completed exclude the multiplayer mode.

            </p>
            <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                We use Unity3D to develop the game's environment, obstacles, and material.
                The programming language which we will use is C Sharp (CS)
                Blender is also used to create players' models.
                We need to have a Unity3D and Blender license to make the game.
                The recommended requirement for hardware is:
                Unity3D: 16GB RAM, 64-bit eight-core CPU, GPU with more than 4GB VRAM, Full HD Monitor, mouse, trackpad, or tablet+pen.
                Blender: 16GB RAM, 64-bit eight-core CPU, GPU with more than 4GB VRAM, Full HD Monitor, mouse, trackpad, or tablet+pen.
                The version for Unity3D is 2021.3, and Blender is 3.5.
                
            </p>
            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>
                In the testing process, we will test each part differently. For example, if we want to determine whether the game operates correctly, we will launch a test server allowing players to participate. Network testing for multiplayer will be tested when the game is about to launch the multiplayer mode.
                When there is no bug or error feedback from our users, we will know if our game has run smoothly, and we will proceed to another step and continue to test.
                The tester will need to pre-register to try the game. There will be a limited sign-up for testing. We randomly pick who will become a tester; no background is required. The estimated number of testers will be around 2000 users. During the testing time, players will be able to send us feedback about bugs and errors. Even when the game is complete, they can do it. 
                
            </p>
            <h3>Risks</h3>
            <p>
                There are several risks that our team has to face. Firstly, this game requires complicated graphics and content, limiting our ability to deliver the project as expected. In more detail, we must spend all our time and money on this project when we want everyone to know this game. Secondly, with the massive amount of information in this game, searching the precise images and sounds worldwide is risky. As a result, the consumers need a better experience in the game, and our team will get bad feedback. Finally, this game requires high graphics, so we cannot approach our player’s needs without good marketing.

            </p>
            <h3>Group processes and communications</h3>
            <p>
                In the future, we will connect through Facebook and Google Meetings, and whenever a member has difficulties, we will meet face-to-face to deal with it together. If a group member does not respond to me, I will try to keep in touch with them through phone number and ask if they need help with something, even a problem in their life. Being a part of the team, we have to support each other to build the relationship in the group.

            <p>
                We are a new team to perform a new game, so we need more people to help us now and in the future. Firstly, we need a person with leadership and management experience to control the rest of the team members. If we can hire this person, it will be easier for us to manage this from a distance, through this guy. Secondly, we need two more IT engineers, who are masters at coding, to develop and fix the project when required. On top of that, an IT engineer with the ability to connect all the members is essential. The reason is that when the team has conflicts, this person can stand in the middle and solve all the problems. Therefore, the team can develop powerfully and perfectly.

            <h3>Huy</h3>
            <p>
                As a member in this group, I wrote a report about timeframe, risks, group processes and communications, skills, and jobs parts. In more detail, my mission is to plan our project until it is finished. I give out the risks of our project so that we can limit the difficulties during doing this game. Being in this group, I met the deadline very soon because all members of the team are very active, and they help each other when anyone needs it. I hope we can become good partners in the future and do more projects together.
            </p>

                 To be honest, our team has done their tasks well, and everyone supports each other. They have a high level of responsibility for their missions. My job is to give them their tasks, help them understand and support their given missions and organize all the report. However, some things need to be improved, such as the design of the project and more focus on time. This took more time than anything else in this task. From the presentation, we use many ideas to make this report better. There are many things that surprise me, but the most important thing is solidary, we now much more actively help each other. That's what I learned about this group and did all the given tasks on time.

                The team has worked very well, and everyone supports each other. They are highly responsible for what they are doing and are usually on time. However, some things need to be improved, such as coding and designing the project. This took more time than everything in this assignment. This group has a tremendous working manner and quality. Being on time is the best thing. Everything has gone well, from the presentation to working together and building up the HTML code. There are a lot of surprises for me, but the most important thing is that this team knows how to cooperate and make plans to execute the work quickly. This is the thing that I have learned about this group.

            <h3>Thinh</h3>
            <p>
                At the end of my time on the task in the group, I found the assignment and completion of the task before the allotted time very reasonable, and the information was fully given. Compared to the previous exercise, our team has improved in saving time and actively helping each other, there is nothing that needs further improvement.
Nothing too surprising, but I found the work of the team members to be very good, with no basic errors and excellent work on the project. In addition, I learned about their patience and above all their teamwork when they had difficulty in finding information about the project and the great contribution of each member.
            </p>
            <h3>Group</h3>
                <p>
                    As the whole group, the first time we worked together on the first assignment, some were introverted and less energetic. However, at the moment, all of us are changing to be better and fit entirely in this team. For the last 2 group assignments, we are getting closer and more energetic in group discussions and coming up with some ideas more confidently and naturally. It is getting better and better through these assignments. Although we have different results from the personality tests, we still ignore that and change ourselves and become best friends or teammates. Of course, in this assignment, there are many things that are better than the previous work. Each member’s group skills are getting better and better and our skills and knowledge about IT is increasingly enhancing. On the other side, there are still some points that need to be improved such as needing to create their work more professionally and handle the situation more decisively on our ideas. I have learned that groups are very effective in completing tasks. When group members work together, they can combine their knowledge and skills to achieve more than they could achieve alone. I also learned that groups can be very creative. When group members share ideas, new and innovative solutions to problems can be found.
